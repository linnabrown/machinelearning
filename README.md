huangleknn:
This is my knn code to distinguish the written data of `28*28` images from *MINST* image data set.
MNIST.mat has `28*28*60000` train_images, `1*60000` train_labels,`28*28*10000`test_images and `1*10000`test_labels.
And *huangleknn.m* is the matlab code.

Here is the function of the code:

    1. Realize the calculation of the error classification rate of the training dataset.
    2. Realize the calculation of the error classification rate of the testing dataset.
    3. Realize the ten-fold cross verification method to choose the best K value from 1~120 of knn method.

If you have any question about my code, welcome to discuss with me on the Issue column  :) or chat me with email 505103350@qq.com
